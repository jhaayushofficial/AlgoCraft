# AlgoCraft

So far there are 6 segments

- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Convex Hull
- Binary Search Game
- Recursion Tree
- Turing Machine

I have implemented a total of `24 algorithms` so far. And will try to add more later.

## Algorithms implemented

- Graph Search
  - DFS
  - BFS
  - Dijkstra
  - A star
  - Recursive Maze Creation
- Sorting
  - Bubble sort
  - Selection sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Heap sort
  - Merge sort
  - Quick sort
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Archimedes Spiral
- N Queen Backtracking
- Graham Scan for Convex Hull
- Binary Search
- Recursion

  - Fibonacci Number
  - Binomial Coefficient
  - Derangement
  - Fast Exponentiation
  - Stirling Number of Second Kind

- Turing Machine
  - Bitwise NOT
  - Increment one
  - 2's Compliment

I am not sure if anyone would like to contribute to this project or not. But any kind of contributions are welcomes. Also if you like this please star this repo. It keeps me motivated.

### Run locally

Make sure you have node installed in your system. Then run

```bash
npm i
